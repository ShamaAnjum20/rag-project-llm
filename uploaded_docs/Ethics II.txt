UNIT III: REGULATING INTERNET CONTENT,TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY
1. Introduction
The internet has become a global platform for communication, information sharing, and innovation. However, with its vast reach, it also raises concerns about misuse, offensive content, privacy violations, and safety risks. Thus, regulating internet content is essential to balance freedom of expression and public safety.

2. In Defense of Freedom of Expression
Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to share ideas and opinions without fear of censorship. On the internet, it encourages creativity, debate, and democracy. However, it must be balanced against hate speech, misinformation, and content that harms individuals or society.

3. Censorship
Censorship refers to the suppression or control of information or speech that may be considered harmful, offensive, or politically sensitive. Governments, organizations, or online platforms may censor content to maintain order or protect public morals, but excessive censorship can violate free speech rights.

4. Laws Upholding Free Speech
Many countries have constitutional or legal provisions protecting free speech.
* Example: The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech.

* In India: Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution ensures freedom of speech and expression, subject to reasonable restrictions (e.g., national security, public order, decency).

9. Assessment of Safety and Risk
Assessing safety and risk means identifying potential threats to users or systems and evaluating their likelihood and impact. Risk assessment helps prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first to ensure maximum protection.
________________


10. Risk-Benefit Analysis
This analysis compares the potential benefits of technology with the possible risks involved. For example, social media offers communication benefits but poses privacy risks. The goal is to maximize benefits while minimizing harm through policies and safeguards.

11. Reducing Risk
Risk reduction involves preventive measures such as:
   * Using firewalls and antivirus software

   * Enforcing strong passwords and authentication

   * Educating users about cyber threats

   * Regular system updates and data backups

   * Adopting ethical online behavior

UNIT IV – COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES
Introduction
Accessibility in computer technologies ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use digital tools and services. It promotes inclusiveness and removes barriers in technology usage.
Principle of Equal Access
Everyone should have equal opportunity to access and benefit from computer technologies, regardless of age, gender, or disability. This principle supports fairness and inclusion.
Obstacles to Access for Individuals
Barriers such as lack of adaptive technology, poor interface design, high costs, and lack of awareness can prevent people—especially those with disabilities—from accessing computer systems.
Professional Responsibility
IT professionals are ethically responsible for designing accessible systems and ensuring technology benefits everyone without discrimination or exclusion.
